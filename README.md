# CM_barrier
Cell merging method for shallow water barrier problems in 2D

This incorporates the cell merging method (for details see M.H. Chung)
on barriers embedded on a quadrilateral grid. This is a cut cell
method. The underlying equations are the 2D shallow water equations.

The `step2ds.f90` under Linear and V directory, along with all the 
F90 and PY files go under `pyclaw/src/pyclaw/classic` in the Pyclaw 
package. 

The TXT file generated by geom_codes go under the examples 
directory

The files in python directory go under `pyclaw/src/pyclaw` in the Pyclaw
package.

Running `python barrier_slanted_CM.py` or `python barrier_V_CM.py` in the 
examples directory will generate `_output` and a plots folder within the 
examples directory.
